# R-Workshop
https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/github.html

My work-along repository for the "R for Excel Users" workshop I found online.

Earlier, I've added this line in my local R-Studio IDE. Committing and uploading to the cloud worked. 

I then "disconnected" again because the "push" button within R-Studio would not work, allowing me only to push the files to the cloud using the Shell... which was inconvenient. I hope it may now work better - though would be surprised if it did!
